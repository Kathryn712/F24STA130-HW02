    "You started with a Monte Hall problem simulation code, asking for a simpler and more understandable version of the logic inside the for loop. The original simulation had the player always switching doors after Monty reveals a \"goat\" door. I refactored the code to make the loop clearer and easier to explain, particularly by using list comprehensions and clarifying the switching process.\n",

    "If you run this code with reps = 100,000, you should observe that the win rate by switching is approximately 0.666 (around 66.67%), confirming that switching doors increases your chances of winning to 2/3 compared to sticking with the original choice (1/3 chance of winning)."

    "In my interactive experience with the chatbot, I could see its potential in helping with learning and problem solving. It helps me understand the concepts of coding, statistics and data science more effectively. I think what works best for me is that it gives detailed answers. It allows me to better understand complex coding. Since joining the course, I have developed some ideas about AIDS for learning coding, statistics, and artificial intelligence. I'm always trying new things but I'm also skeptical. However, with the increase of using it, I found that it improved the efficiency of learning. As long as we don't rely on chatbots, we can get more learning resources through it. At the same time, this new way of learning also breaks the traditional way of learning. I think this way of learning adds an interactive experience to facilitate learning. Overall, I have a deeper understanding of AI learning."
